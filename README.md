# Statistical Inference Course Project
Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera

## Method
Content was created with R code and markdown that was put into files in "Rmd" format and then "html" files were generated from RStudio.

## Part 1 Overview
Investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). According to the CLT the distribution of sample means follow normal distribution.

Investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials for a thousand simulations.

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

## Part 2 Overview
Basic inferential data analysis, analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
